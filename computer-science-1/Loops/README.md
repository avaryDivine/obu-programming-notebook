# HW-013

## 4.1 Loops(general)
1. Describe a loop body

  loop statements/ the things that are executed every loop
2. Describe a loop iteration

  each time through the loop body/ statements
3. Demonstrate Java implementation to compute an average (no answer needed in the homework)
4. Demonstrate Java implementation to count specific values in a list (no answer needed in the homework)
5. Demonstrate Java implementation to find the maximum value in a list (no answer needed in the homework)
   
## 4.2 While Loops
1. Demonstrate Java code to get a value from the user (int, float / double, char, String, etc.)

  userNum = scnr.nextInt()
  userDoub = scnr.next()
  userChar = scnr.next().charAt()
2. Demonstrate Java implementation of a while loop (provide example code)
```
  while (numPeople < 8) {
    System.out.println("Num people is " + numPeople);
    numPeople = numPeople + 1;
}
```
3. Demonstrate Java implementation of loop expressions (provide example code)

   see num 2
4. Demonstrate Java implementation of a while loop that modifies the loop condition inside the loop (provide example code)

    see num 2
5. Describe an infinite loop and an example of how it can happen

  never altering the value in the body
6. Demonstrate Java implementation of a while loop with a sentinel value (provide example code)
