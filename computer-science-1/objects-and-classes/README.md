# HW-022
## 8.4 Mutators, accessors, and private helpers
1. Describe a mutator

a method that may modify a classes field
2. Describe an accessor

method that accesses fields but may not modify them
3. Describe a setter / getter

setter is a mutator, getter is an accessor
4. Describe a private helper method

only called from classes other methods, cant be called by other classes

## 8.5 Initializations and constructors
1. Describe the purpose and use of a constructor

   used to initialize all fields, no return type
   
## 7.1
1. Define an object:
   
   grouping of operations and data or methods and variables
3. Define abstraction (aka information hiding, encapsulation):
   
  When user interacts with data on a high level, lowlevel information is hidden

## 7.2
1. Describe a (Java) class:
   
   defines a new type used to group data and methods to create an object
3. Describe public member methods:
   
   all of the operations that a class can use on an object
5. Describe a reference variable:
   
   refers to instance of a class 
7. Describe the purpose and use of the new operator:
   
   allocates an object to the class type
   
   Restaurant favLunchPlace = new Restaurant(); creates a Restaurant object named favLunchPlace.
9. Describe the purpose and use of the member access operator:
    
    "." invokes a method on an object

   favLunchPlace.setRating(4) calls the setRating() method on the favLunchPlace object, which sets the object's rating to 4.

## 7.3
1. Describe the purpose and use of private fields:

   variables that only member methods can access, class users can not access it
3. Describe a (class) method definition:
