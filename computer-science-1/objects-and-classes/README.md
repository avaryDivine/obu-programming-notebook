[Objects and Classes](computer-science-i/README.md)

# HW-023
## 8.7 Defining main() in a programmer define class
1. Describe the purpose of the main() method and the steps to implement one

static method, independent of class objects, can access other static methods or static fields, can not access non-static methods
## 8.8 Unit Testing (classes)
1. Describe the purpose of unit testing

create and run a test for a specific method or unit
2. Describe the purpose of a test case

input/output checks
3. Describe border cases

unusual or extreme cases
4. Describe regression testing

retest item like class anytime the item is changed
## 8.9 Constructor Overloading
1. Describe constructor overloading and why it might be used

# HW-022
## 8.4 Mutators, accessors, and private helpers
1. Describe a mutator

a method that may modify a classes field
2. Describe an accessor

method that accesses fields but may not modify them
3. Describe a setter / getter

setter is a mutator, getter is an accessor
4. Describe a private helper method

only called from classes other methods, cant be called by other classes

## 8.5 Initializations and constructors
1. Describe the purpose and use of a constructor

   used to initialize all fields, no return type
   
## 7.1
1. Define an object:
   
   grouping of operations and data or methods and variables
3. Define abstraction (aka information hiding, encapsulation):
   
  When user interacts with data on a high level, lowlevel information is hidden

## 7.2
1. Describe a (Java) class:
   
   defines a new type used to group data and methods to create an object
3. Describe public member methods:
   
   all of the operations that a class can use on an object
5. Describe a reference variable:
   
   refers to instance of a class 
7. Describe the purpose and use of the new operator:
   
   allocates an object to the class type
   
   Restaurant favLunchPlace = new Restaurant(); creates a Restaurant object named favLunchPlace.
9. Describe the purpose and use of the member access operator:
    
    "." invokes a method on an object

   favLunchPlace.setRating(4) calls the setRating() method on the favLunchPlace object, which sets the object's rating to 4.

## 7.3
1. Describe the purpose and use of private fields:

   variables that only member methods can access, class users can not access it
3. Describe a (class) method definition:
