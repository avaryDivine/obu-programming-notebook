## 3.2 Detecting Equal Values with Branches
1. Describe and give example Java code to detect if two items are equal

use double equal (==), if numDogs == 6
  
3. Describe and give example Java code to select among two options (you can just print out the result of the selection)

  ```
x = 6;
if (x == 6) {
         System.out.println("True");
      }
else {
         System.out.println("False");
      }
```
3. Describe and give example Java code to select among more than two options (print the result)

```
numPeople = 25;
if (numPeople == 0) {
         System.out.println("not zero");
      }
else if (numPeople == 10) {
         System.out.println("not 10");
      }
else {
          System.out.print("some other value")
      }
```

4. Describe and give example Java code for the correct way to compare strings for equality

   instead of usig == you would use something like equals() or comparesTo()

## 3.4 Detecting Ranges with Branches
1. Describe and give example Java code to detect a range (using logical operators and gaps)

   







































# 3.11 Switch Statements
1. Describe the purpose of a switch statement

   represent multi-branch behavior more clearly involves variable being compared to constant values
2. Provide an example use of a switch statement

   ```
   switch (numPeople) {
     case 6:
       ticketPrice = 1.00;
       break;
     case 14:
       ticketPrice = 3.00;
       break;
     case 18:
       ticketPrice = 5.00;
       break;
     default:
       ticketPrice = 7.00;
       break;
   }
   ```
# 3.12 Boolean Data Type
1. Demonstrate (give an example) of a Java declaration of a Boolean variable and assignment and a Boolean literal and an expression

   
# 3.13 String Comparisons
1. Demonstrate (give an example) of the correct way to do String comparisons in Java

   
# 3.14 String Access Operations
1. Demonstrate Java code for accessing a character (including the last character) in a String

   
# 3.15 Character Operations
1. Demonstrate Java code to determine if a character is a letter, digit or whitespace.
