## 3.2 Detecting Equal Values with Branches
1. Describe and give example Java code to detect if two items are equal

use double equal (==), if numDogs == 6
  
3. Describe and give example Java code to select among two options (you can just print out the result of the selection)

  ```
x = 6;
if (x == 6) {
         System.out.println("True");
      }
else {
         System.out.println("False");
      }
```
3. Describe and give example Java code to select among more than two options (print the result)

```
numPeople = 25;
if (numPeople == 0) {
         System.out.println("not zero");
      }
else if (numPeople == 10) {
         System.out.println("not 10");
      }
else {
          System.out.print("some other value")
      }
```

4. Describe and give example Java code for the correct way to compare strings for equality

   

## 3.4 Detecting Ranges with Branches
1. Describe and give example Java code to detect a range (using logical operators and gaps)
